# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

-This project looked to refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. Building upon the MERN stack, GraphQL API will restructure the appropriate routes and structure for funcationality. 

-The Apollo Server was set-up to use GraphQL queries and mutations based upon the previous API.

-The previous authMiddleware was restructured with GraphQL context.

-The Apollo Provider in app.js was constructed to communicate with Apollo Client.
